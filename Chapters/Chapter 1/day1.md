# Chapter 1 - Day 1

1. Blockchains are database systems, that are shared between many computers. Data is getting put into a block, that when filled up, is added to the chain. 
When data is enterend to a decentralized blockchain, it becomes irreversible, so all the transactions are permanently recorded and can be viewed by anyone.

2. Smart Constract is a program stored on a blockchain which runs when set criteria are met. When it is deployed to the Blockchain, anyone can interact with it. 

3. Transactions vs. Scripts:
Script is used only for viewing the data, whereas the Transaction is altering the data. 

4. TestNet vs. MainNet
TestNet is an enviroment for testing the DApplications before the actual release. NO actual money is used. It is a great way to test the DApp for vulnerabilities. 
MainNet is an enviroment for deploying the application and letting the public use it. Real money is involved and if a vulnerability is found, it is a bad bad situation.
