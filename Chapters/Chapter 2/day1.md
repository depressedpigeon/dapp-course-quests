# Chapter 2 - Day 1

## 1. Backend vs Front-End
Front-end is what happens on your machine (computer), it is what we see on the screen and how we intercat with it.
Backend is what happens behind the pretty UI. What processes happen on the servers, in databases. It is usually run not on the client, but somewhere separately. 
Example: 
Front-end - UI of a Real Estate firm, where you can see the listings on the main page and when you click a listing, it pups-up, letting you see more information about it. 
Back-end - the information of the listing is stored on some server in Norway in a database and the backend loads it and sends to the Front-end for display. 

## 2. Global styling - affects the whole project.
Module styling - affects only selected module and will be active only if imported in a selected file.

## 3. Screenshot of a running application.
Note: This screenshot is not from the first screen, as I forgot to take a screenshot in the very beginning. This is a screenshot somewhere along the way ('__')
